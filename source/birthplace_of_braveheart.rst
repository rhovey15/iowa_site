Birthplace of Braveheart
========================

One day in Ankeny, Iowa Mel Gibson and longtime friend, Randall Wallace created the idea of a little movie called Braveheart. Whilst LARPing in the kitchen at the meeting of William Wallace (Randallâ€™s great-great-great-great Grandfather) Gibson jokingly mentioned, as he struck down a party of 14 year olds from a rival clan they had invited, that they should totally make this into a movie. With this utterance and his face painted blue, Gibson and Wallace sat down and wrote the entire script to Braveheart in one sitting. 

*The Class of Gibson*
Gibson gives a lot, if not all, of his inspiration to the location where he had the idea of the film. 

	"I could not have conceived such a moving and inspirational tale of the Scottish Independence and the war again King Edward the first were it not for my beautiful home at Woodland Reserve."

**The Reserve**

Now the Woodland Reserve is a humble apartment complex in Ankeny, Iowa. Years ago when Mr. Gibson resided there for this short period, the reserve was a temporary home to many wayward artists. The likes of Paul McCartney and Ron Livingston, star of Office Space, frequented the domicile. Now aspiring thespians from across the United States flock to this area in hopes of acquiring the same stroke of good fortune that so many before them have found.
