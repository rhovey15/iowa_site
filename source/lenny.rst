Lenny
=====

You’ll be hard pressed to find a person who doesn’t love Legos but the people in Iowa have taken it a step farther.
Found in one of the major cities in Iowa is Lenny, a large version of a Lego minifigure, enjoying whatever weather 
the day brings his way. 

Lenny has been standing proud since 2009, but his past is a little less bold than he is. The community is in love 
with their giant plastic friend, and there is a celebration for Lenny in May of every year. 
The festival takes place over a weekend when families can have fun together, eat the local food, 
and of course, celebrate Legos. 

Not all is shiny and bright with Lenny however. No one knows where Lenny came from and may theories have risen about his origins. The logical is the most accepted believe; Lenny was put up by someone who enjoyed the toys, and wanted to share his enjoyment with the community.
Theorists say this is not the case. On their website, “The Lenny Files” they document and share their conspiracies surrounding the proud plastic man.
