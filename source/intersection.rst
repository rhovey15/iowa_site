Intersection
============
For one reason or another, this intersection has been memorialized by the people who live near it. 
It’s importance dates back to war time in Iowa. At this historical intersection, two well-known generals passed by one another 
on their way to different bases. As the story goes, they greeted each other with a fair “How do you do?” 
and kept on going their separate ways. 

As most attractions go this one sounds very dull. However, it’s not about the attraction that makes this intersection worth visiting. 
The nearby town goes nuts about the intersection, their only claim to fame. Visitors become mesmerized 
by the dedication the townies have to their “famous” intersection.

The story of what happened can be recalled by even a school child here, and not a single person 
in town would hesitate in telling you the whole tale if you were unfamiliar. At peek tourist 
times during the summer you’ll find people selling t-shirts and mugs to memorialize 
their beloved event. You’ll see food designed to commemorate the meeting at the intersection, 
and hourly reenactments during their festival. 

I can’t tell you why or how these hicks developed such a fascination for something so 
seemingly boring, and it has sparked many a scientific inquiry as to what could be in 
the water of the town.
