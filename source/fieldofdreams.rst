Field of Dreams
===============

One of the most iconic places to visit in Iowa is the Field of Dreams in quaint
little town of Dyersville. Named after the movie that was filmed there,
“Field of Dreams”, this baseball field will grab your attention right off the
bat with its unique outfield fence of a corn field. Everything original from the
time they were filming the movie still stands. Sometimes they even have a mock
baseball game happen at the field to commemorate the making of the movie and the
people that used to play on the field in the past. You can even walk in or out
of the corn field in the outfield like thousands of people do a year, replicating
the movie when the players would walk out of the field when the game was starting
and back into the field when the game was over. Make sure to bring your own glove
and a ball when you come and visit. Granted there are some free gloves and
baseballs to use at the field, it feels a lot better using your own mitt and ball
when getting ready to take some pictures playing catch at the site of a famous Iowa film.
