Graduation Boulder
==================

Senior photos are a *drag* for high school students all across the country. This is especially true for students in Iowa, 
where you have two choices: **holding a corn cob**, or find yourself **plastered against the side of a barn**. However, 
Iowan senior photos changed forever with the discovery of this impressive rock, that has since been dubbed “*Graduation Boulder*” 
for the tradition it inspired. 

High school graduate hopefuls come to Graduation Boulder all times of the year to get their photos taken. Flipping through 
the yearbooks of schools around the state will show you just how much people enjoy the photogenic qualities the rock offers. 

Graduation Boulder has grown to mean so much more since the first photos were taken. You’ll see wedding parties posing by 
the rock, pets getting their photos taken in its shadow, and even a presidential candidate or two taking part. If you want 
to visit Graduation Boulder, experts say the best time to visit is during Autumn. The trees in the area add the perfect 
background and kids have begun the procrastination of their senior photos. 

When you take the time to visit Graduation Boulder with your friends and loved ones, the old stone isn’t the only thing 
that will last forever. The memories you make there will stay strong for a lifetime. To learn more about boulders click `here
